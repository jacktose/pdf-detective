# pdf-detective

Certain downloaded PDFs (through Google Scholar?) have an image added with vertical gray text including the URL to the document's source.
The unique bits of the URL appear to be present in the PDF's `Title` metadatum, so just pull that out and transform it into the URL.

## Usage
Just download the important files here: https://github.com/jacktose/pdf-detective/raw/main/pdf-detective.tar  
Unzip them into the folder with the PDFs in it.  
Run `./pdf-detective [--help]`
